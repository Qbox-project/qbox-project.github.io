# Converting from QBCore

<Steps>
### Check your job grades in `qbx_core/shared/jobs.lua`.
  In Qbox, job grades are numbers without quotations, whereas in QBCore they are strings.
### Configure ox_inventory and convert your database.
  Back it up first! ([see ox_inventory documentation](https://overextended.dev/ox_inventory/Frameworks/qb))
### Qbox has multicharacter built into qbx_core.
  If you want to keep using your own multicharacter resource, configure qbx_core accordingly.
  Otherwise you can disable or delete your old multicharacter resource.
### Qbox has a queue system built into qbx_core.
  If you want to keep using your own queue system, specify `set qbx:enablequeue "false"` inside your cfg file.
  Otherwise you can disable or delete your old queue system.
### Modify your `players` table
- Add to the `players` table to add the new column `last_logged_out`
- Change the collation of players.citizenid column to `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` you may also need to change citizenid columns to this collation in other tables
if they have a foreign key constraint to the players table.
### Configure multijob/multigang
  Qbox has a multijob/gang system built into core that cannot be disabled. By default, players may only be in one job & gang. This can be overriden by setting `qbx:max_jobs_per_player` and `qbx:max_gangs_per_player` in server.cfg.
  Do not use an external multijob/gang resource that isn't guaranteed by the developer to be Qbox compatible.
  Using incompatible multijobs or resources which modify core's database tables may lead to data corruption. First, double check that the player.citizenid column in your database has collation `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`. If not, change it.
  Then, run qbx_core.sql to create the new player_groups table. Start the server and type `convertjobs` into the txAdmin console once the server is running to populate the player_groups table.
  This needs to be done even if you don't already have a multijob/gang system.
</Steps>
## Migrating a resource from QBCore to Qbox

<Callout type="info">
  This is optional as Qbox has 99% compatibility with existing QB scripts
</Callout>

Within Qbox, the core object no longer exists.
Instead, the data can be accessed via a combination of export functions and imported modules.

1. Import the needed modules from qbx_core to supply replacement functions for ones from QBCore;
2. Replace calls to QBCore one by one with calls to the imported modules and exported functions. Both can be used at the same time, so conversion can be done partially, or over time.

### Common replacements

```lua
QBCore.Functions. -> exports.qbx_core:
QBCore.Functions.GetPlayerData() -> QBX.PlayerData -- requires importing the playerdata module
QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle) -> qbx.getVehiclePlate(vehicle) -- requires importing the lib module
QBCore.Shared.Jobs -> exports.qbx_core:GetJobs()
QBCore.Shared.Gangs -> exports.qbx_core:GetGangs()
QBCore.Shared.Vehicles -> exports.qbx_core:GetVehiclesByName()
QBCore.Shared.Weapons -> exports.qbx_core:GetWeapons()
QBCore.Shared.Locations -> exports.qbx_core:GetLocations()
QBCore.Shared.Items -> exports.ox_inventory:Items()

exports['qb-core']:KeyPressed() -> lib.hideTextUI()
exports['qb-core']:HideText() -> lib.hideTextUI()
exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, position) -> lib.showTextUI(text, { position = position })
exports['qb-core']:ChangeText(text, position) -> lib.hideTextUI() lib.showTextUI(text, { position = position })
```
